Just a few hundred meters of horizontal separationcan yield greatly different results. Only an experienced operator can determine the extent to which adjacent waves sensors would agree. Nevertheless, the test should not be overlooked where it may have application.This test is similar to the LT time series wave parameters max/min/acceptable range (test 19),where theagreement is constrained to matching the second wave sensorwithin allowable difference (Delta). The selected thresholds depend entirely upon the relationship between thetwo sensors as determined by the local knowledge of the operator.In the instructions and examples below, bulk parameter data from one site (W1) are compared to a second site (W2)."},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.038682Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.038431Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.043986Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.043193Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.038659Z"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"def test_21(df1,df2,delta):\n    flag = 1\n    for i in range(len(df1)-1):\n        diff = abs(df1[i]-df2[i])\n        if diff>delta:\n            flag = 3\n            print(i,df1[i],df2[i])\n    return flag\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.045433Z","iopub.status.busy":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.045094Z","iopub.status.idle":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.13234Z","shell.execute_reply":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.131415Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2021-05-26T11:10:37.045403Z"},"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"test_21(calm_weather.hm0,stormy_weather.hm0,10)#doesnt really make sense seeing as this test only applies to measurements taken \n                                               #at the same time in close locations, but the test should run fine once we have that data","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"name":"python3","display_name":"Python 3","language":"python"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.13","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
